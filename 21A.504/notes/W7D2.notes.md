        - made by guy who made atari
        - first coin operated game ever
        - too complicated and was not a success
    - Pong
        - the big thing
        - it is so simple
        - makes people realize the potential of video and arcade games
- Arcades was the first step to moving to video game industry
- the next step was home consoles
- Atari started making one console with multiple games in 1976
- by 1982 worldwide
    - home console sales of video games was 3 billion dollars
    - arcade games was 8 billion dollars
    - at time movie industry was only 3 billion to give idea
- Nintendo comes in after there is hault in innovation in video games
- by 1990 its present in 1/3 of all north american homes, 5 years after entering
- the number 1 rival for Nintendo was Sega
- personal computers were first thought as something serious, for work and not to
    be messed around on
- video games started entering personal computers as hardware became better
- __DOOM__ was huge in 1990s
    - first to use multiplayer over network
    - first to have free version and pay to play version

## Game Design

- since the beginning, video game companies wanted to target young boys
- this meant marketing, advertisement, and the games themselves were all
    directed toward young boys
- this left girls pretty much all the way out of video games
- then they started targeting older "more mature" populatioin
- this meant that the video games starting including much much more violence
- Sega specifically says their video games are more violent as a selling point
- Girls in video games
    - 1990s game industry starts producing "girl specific" games
    - games like barbie dress up games starting popping up
        - they were hugely popular
    - __PINK Games__
        - inherent interests in clothes, makeup, dressup, etc
    - __Purple Games__
        - idea that girls are interested in gossip and building relationships
    - at first this revolution was celebrated, then it was frowned upon because
        it reinforced the gender splits
        - girls like clothes and friends
        - guys like sports and violence

## Representation of Women and Minorities

- studies of first person shooters in the 1990s all show that a HUGE majority
    of the video games have WHITE MALE characters
- they started adding women and diversity as protagonists in video games
- for example, early example was __Tomb Raider__ who has protagonist: __Lara Craft__
- __Lara Craft__:
    - positives:
        - badass main character in tomb raider
        - gave women first chance to play with this badass girl
    - negatives:
        - her presentation is very sexualized
        - it proves the vidoe game is still only trying to please the man
- __Damsel in Distress:__
    - even when girls entered video games, they were usually just used as props
    - this make them feel even more as objectified props
    - they are just there to get male protagonist motivated
- highly reccommended to watch "tropes vs women"
- Asians are rarely ever in games, except martial arts games
    - reinforces the idea that they're foreigners
- African americans also faced simliar problems
- the game industry reinforces all the stereotypes around gender, race, etc
- this split and stereotyping is argued to be worse in video games than other
    industries like movie etc
    - the argument comes from the fact that you are actively participating in
        the game and actively giving consent to these choices
- issue why underrepresentation: not enough women and minorities working as
    game designers

## Online Misogyny and Racism

- Gamergate:
    - Zoe Quinn: video game developer
        - accused by ex bf for sleeping with journalist for better readings
        - started receiving death threats and hate mail
