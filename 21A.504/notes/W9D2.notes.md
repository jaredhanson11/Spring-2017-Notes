## Ramification of Snowden

- people's searches of peronally sensitive and publicly sensitive decreased a lot
- traffic to wikipedia pages on things that can be associated with national
    security (isis, bombs, etc.) decreased a lot
- Alma's chilling effect:
    - she's a part of history of science society, and it's main journal is
        called isis
        - research in the past 3 months of Alma's search history should raise
            concerns
            - about ISIS for research
            - about Snowden for class
        - additionally, she's on a green card, not a US citizen
        - she starts monitoring herself, because she will eventually apply for
            citizenship
- the main point isn't that you are ACTUALLY getting surveilled, it's more just
    the fact that you could be and people are aware of it and could potentially
    change behavior because they think they're being watched
- just like in 18 century pentoptagon?, idea that uncertainty about whether or
    not you're being watched at the exact moment, but you could be watched,
    leads people to live like they're constantly being surveilled
- argument against "I have nothing to hide"
    - it divides the world into the idea that there are bad people and good people
        - good people have nothing to hide
        - bad people have things to hide
    - when we think about bad people we think about terrorists and people who
        we want to be watched
    - often times though, the bad people aren't just the terrorists, they are
        the journalists, the activists, and others who opposed the current power
