#Fruits of the Conflict: Machinery 1922

## Howard Tolley
- computer for Coast and Geodetic Survey office in Washington
- realized that computers (people) didn't provide anything and they just
    followed the same mindless steps always
- hated especially being a computer at a big place like Coast and Geodetic
    Survey office
- got a new job at Dept. of Agriculture as mathematician

## Harry C. Wallace
- Dept of Agriculture secretary under Warren G. Harding
- created new research office, Buereau of Agricultural Economics
    - this office used lease squares from Doolittle (kinda through Tolley)
    - very different use, in agriculture, to use the math method than in the
        survey's the method is usually used for
    - called __regression analysis__ aka *the analysis of variance*
- taught least squares to Iowa State, alma mater

## Applying least squares in agriculture
- main problem
    - you needed a computing office, because you still have the same
        computing, if not more, to do in agriculture than in survey adjustments
    - punch card equipment could sumarize data for many applications, but it
        needed to be used in special way for least squares calculations
- solution:
    - could use __progressive digiting__ but it required skilled and attentive operator
        - in real world, progressive digiting is awkward and hard when it
            should be easy
    - in 1923 Tolley started to make centralized Bureau of Agriculture
        computing laboratory
        - announced in May, â€œtabulating and computing services will be available
            to all engaged in economics research"
        - workers would just follow instructions from Lab for calculating whatever

## Mary Clem
- played big role in Snedecor's lab
- she found "zero checks", places where it should sum to zero if calculations
    have been correct
- showed them to Snedecor and became planner of lab
