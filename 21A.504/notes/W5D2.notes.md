## ARPANET to Internet

__ARPA:__ advanced projects research agency

- created as a direct response to Sputnik

- computers moved from batch processesing to time-sharing
    - timesharing: different terminals were connected to one computer, users
        both feel like they just have their own terminal
    - question answered from time-sharing:
        - why use different terminals for seperate computers, why not just one
            terminal and multiple computers
- __ARPANET:__ connecting different computers around the world that have
    different computer power and provide different services
    - wanted to stretch across the country
    - research centers in ARPA didn't want to connect to ARPANET, why would
        they want to give up their computing power?
    - all the research centers using any ARPA money had to switch though
    - __Information Message Processor(IMP):__ now just called a router
    - by 19__69__, there wwas UCSB, UCLA, SRI?, Utah on network
    - by 1971, there were a lot on the network, and it went coast to coast
    - joining the network was hard though
    - the ARPANET was never really used by researchers either
    - despite original plan of creating a sense of community with arpanet, it
        really didn't serve that purpose
    - __Email:__ feature was the main use of the ARPANET
        - `@` sign came from ARPANET to signify location at certain center
        - email drove the private companies into the push toward connected networks
    - telephone lines were slow, they looked for new way to send data
        - until now, these networks were all connected through telephone lines
        - __ALOHANET:__ connected U of Hawaii campuses by radio communication
        - __ethernet:__ connected by wire, allows a huge amount bandwidth relative
            to phone lines
        - __satnet:__ arpa started satellite network over atlantic, and also
            radio
- __Internet:__ came because they wanted to connect all these different networks
    - first problem was that all these networks needed to use a standard
        protocol to communicate
    - ARPANET split to ARPANET and MILNET (military net)
    - then government gives up the ARPANET to civilian control, and eventually
        it is privatized to the internet as we know it today
- Origins of ARPANET/internet:
    - some people think the ARPANET was created to survive nuclear attack, because
        it is distributed and survivable
    - some think it was developed to bring scientific researchers together
    - no one knows, we accept both and see how they make the internet today

## Counterculture and the WELL

- Computers and technology were initially seen as military and them having
    control over civilians
- They switched to then being counterculture and free and connected
- Partly this shift was a result of the personal computer
