# Lecture 6: Programming

## Pre-Class
### Artifact Paper due March 15
- You can use from the links on the website for your paper.
    - if using website, don't copy paste from website... she'll look for that
    - and link the picture you're using
    - also make sure to cite your sources
- 3 to 4 pages
    - just to take artifact and think historically
    - think about social constructs with which this was used
    - think about it like what were learning in class
- if you're working in museum, this is the quick info you'd give visitors about
    artifact

## Early Software

Three periods of software

- __1950s:__ reign of mainframes
    - software is developed with contractors
    - companies buy computer and contract out programming
    - companies contractors ex: SDC, Sabre
    - the contractors would do much more than write code
        - they had to train user
        - move procedures around
        - analyze the process and usage much more
        - hardware and software were much more interrelated and connected
    - 1959: first time term *software* is used
        - *software* was defined then as everything that wasn't hardware is
            software
- __1960s:__ computer start moving out and into industry
    - 1964, IBM released System 360
        - system released targeting industry
        - side note: IBM almost failed because they were such successes and
            couldn't keep up with demand
    - software started becoming available and uniform (able to use across
        different companies and for similiar uses)
    - software gap was industry wide crisis, so much so that software was
        bottleneck
        - hardware was up to date but software was expensive, prone to
            breaking, and scarce to find
    - 1968, IBM announces that software and hardware weren't gonna be sold
        together
        - before this break, software didn't really have it's own industry
- development of the personal computer
    - first time computer becomse a mass product

## Rise of Programming languages
- Grace Hopper
    - first person to write an automatic program compiler
    - first person to really make programming english and language
- first real, real high level programming language was __Fortran__
- __Fortran:__ formula translator
    - released in 1957
        - dominant language in 1960s???? for scientific computation
    - targeted at scientific computation
    - they use algebra shorthand, and english shorthand
    - ideas around high level languages before fortran was that no high level
        language could compile to assembly language as well as a good programmer
        could write assembly
    - Fortran really focused on the compiler and that's what made it successful
- programming languages give programmers a sort of profession and identity, but
    it also really seperated the programmer from the hardware
- __COBOL:__ software for business industry
    - goals:
        - machine independent
            - limited calculation to 18 decimals
        - english like syntax
    - developed by the Department of Defense
        - DOD wanted to make sure there was a standard
        - DOD forced all computers bought by them to have COBOL, making IBM add
            COBOL in order to keep DOD as customer

## Programmer's Professional Identity
- programming involved creativity, enginuity
- computer changed identity from tool that needs managing, to tool that really
    aids in managing
    - this idea really pushed women out of programming world
- programmers were arrogant, unkempt, non loyal, antisocial
- managers read articles and books about handling their computer specialists
- __SDC__: company maybe? trained programmers i think
    - study finds, best programmers like things better than people
    - started using personality tests to find ideal programmers
    - these tests really create the norm for what/who programmers were
        - so if you didn't fit personality test, you didn't get trained, even
            if you had the skills
