# Lecture 4: Cybernetics and the Closed World

## Cybernetics
__Norbet Wiener__
- cybernetics is his brain child
- Ph.D from Harvard at 19
- child prodigy
- at 25, joins MIT
- adament about combining theoretical and applied science, like engineering and
    math/science
- most well known for work with __cybernetics__
    - anti aircrafts in WWII made cybernetics
    - goal:
        - see enemy plane on radar
        - figure out flight path
        - direct a gun to shoot gun
        - all of it has to happen in thirty seconds to be useful
    - key discovery: to include the human operator as just a part of the system
        - model/analyze human element and the mechanical element at same time

__cybernetics__
- based around importance of feedback
- main idea:
    - information feedback machine
        - can explain on small and large scale every thing and its
            interactions with its system/environment
        - all through feedback
- everyone now in all fields (psychology, anthropology, etc.)
    incorporates the idea of feedback or information feedback machines
    into their theories
- keys that come from Wiener's Cybernetics book
    - blurring the line between computers/machines and humans
        - Weiner makes connections between human brain and computer
        - talks about how vocab of engineers now became contaminated with
            terms of neurophysiologist and psychologist
        - talks about body itself as a feedback control machine
            - body can control blood pressure
            - maintains temperature
    - idea of information
        - everything is all about the message
            - doesnt matter if its digital, verbal, or what
        - the message is what travels through feedback system
        - information: Wiener describes as negative entropy
            - more disordered system means less information
            - & vice a versa

## The Closed World
- post war gave rise to closed world discourse
- centralized idea of command and control
- computers enabled and are fundamental to the idea of a closed world
    - needed for actual technology to make it possible
        - air defense system
        - nuclear early warning and response
    - computers also were a metaphor
        - computers allow people to see the entire world being controlled and
            overwatched by one centralized computer
        - give vision of dome of control cast over entire world by centralized
            computer
- closed world lead to notion of containment
    - containment was based around containing soviet union and communism
    - led to making capitalistic countries close borders to protect from
        totalitarian communistic regime
- the army was invested in building system so human's and machines can work
    side by side
    - often times, civilians came up with some of the uses of computers in
        military
    - first time computers being used for real time command and control based
        on feedback and such
    - by 50's and 60's computer is used for more systems and is not just a
        giant calculator

__SAGE:__ air defense system
- one of first machines used for defense and not attack
- Soviets had atomic bomb and US was scared so started building defense
    systems
- idea:
    - build a large scale map with centralized computer that monitors
        different sectors of radars for aircraft
    - if it sees a soviet ship
        - analyze aircraft
        - distribute message to proper military sector of that area
- one of first times that tasks of humans were completely automated and
    done by computers, esp in military
    - scared some people
    - everyone talked about how the computer became so much more computerized
    - many people opposed it
- first time we really start *relying* on centralized computer systems

## Dr. Strangelove
- Cold War rationality
    - idea that rationality and decision making could be completely programmed/algorithmic
        - ex: doomsday machine that didn't have human interaction
