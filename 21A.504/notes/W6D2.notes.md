# Guest Lecture: Trust in Code

Guest lecturer: Gili Vidan, Harvard History of Science

From crypto anarchy to cloud formations

## Introduction

- research in the __blockchain__
    - __blockchain:__  way to distribute information

## Idea of trusting code

- tech disrupts __paper belt:__
    - LA: film/music -- now spotify
    - NY: center of media/news -- now facebook

## What is code?

- an object that is based on culture
- bitcoin is argued to be the best of both worlds between what gives money value
    - commodity (ex. backed by gold)
    - ???? (term for being valuable because the insititution gives it value)

## Three Questions

__Who gets to speak on behalf of code?__

__How is a discourse sustained over time?__

__What happens when only see CPU's and the protocols that link them?__

- code is unique because it actually does exactly what it says
- public key encryption became synomous with decentralizing and distributing trust
- moving from both parties needing access to encryption key, to public private key
    encryption was huge step in security
- public key encryption also accomplished creating an open crytographic community
- Dorothy Denning:
    - wrote: the future of cryptography
    - talked about how cryptography would lead to anarchy
- cyber-afro-futurism...??? refutes the idea that cyberspace doesn't have age,
    race, gender, etc


- bitcoin/blockchain problem to solve:
    - to eliminate the need for a middle party when transacting
    - to do so in a way that doesn't require a centralized middle man
    - distributes software
- solution:
    - each node has the same code
    - on every transaction, there is a different verifier
    - you won't ever varify your own transaction, or likely you won't
    - makes it really hard and expensive to trick the system and verifiers
- is bitcoin a trustless decentralized middle man based on algorithmic reasoning
    - __Where did the trust in bitcoin code go to?__
    - wallet providers
        - one provider fell off face of earth and stole everyone's money
    - mining pools
    - core development team
        - Gavin Andersen + handpicked team of 5 have full rights to editing all
            codebase to stay agile enough for fast patches
        - bitcoin's code was 32% written by unknown authors, so who's code are
            we really trusting?
- we tend to trust code, but it is dangerous to trust code without trusting the
    author of that code
