### Notes on Citation

- number for footnote comes after the quotation
- cite everything that isn't general knowledge
- should be cited:
    - this artifact was made by this person, for this money, and funded by this service
- if you use footnotes you don't use page numbers in the text itself, put page
    number in footnote
- first footnote is full formatted citation
- second time that article is used again, just write the shorter version of
    quote, don't refer to the first quote in second/3rd/4th... footnote

## The Real, The Virtual, The Actual

- The early promise of the internet was that it'd hide things like
    - race
    - gender
    - if you're a dog or not, etc
- Later, we realized the internet didn't give us those capabilities

Idea behind different identities and some of the differences of virtual identities.

- Online you can experience different parts of yourself at once
    - you can sit in your room and be in the room
    - while still being online as an orc on LOTRO
    - while still being on social media being your dog's instagram etc

__Second life__

- online simulator of a virtual world, where you can experience whatever
    identity you want
- often times video games reaffirm gender and racial stereotypes etc..
    - second life really showed that others did try a different avatar from themselves
        - even made some men who liked being a girl online want to be girl offline
- some argue that you're true self in online world, and in real life you're
    putting on a fake front to conform to society

Binary between "Real" and "Virtual" creates sense that "virtual" isn't real and
therefore lesser. It should be "Actual" and "Virtual" to create different narrative.

Virtual Reality matrix should be used:

|          | Physical            | Virtual            |
| ---      | ---                 | ---                |
| __Real__ | Physical and real   | Vitual and real    |
|__Unreal__| Physical and unreal | Virutal and unreal |

## Social Network Sites and the Self as a Product

- Huge difference between social network and gaming online is that social
    networking is self promotion
    - you're offline and online personas are so directly connected

Ervring Goffman:

- Famous socialologist
- Frontstage self/backstage self: self presentation
    - frontstage is all about being as agreeable with as many people as possible
    - online perpetuates the instant feedback whether something is agreeable or not

- what's different between online and offline identities?
    - online is a collection of components/descriptors/__assets__
