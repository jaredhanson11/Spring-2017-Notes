## Questions while reading

- Write an exhibit wall panel or a brief gallery guide providing the historical
    and social context for the object about which you are writing
- Why were the objects designed?
- For what purpose?
- What kind of work went into making this object?

## [NTDS CP-642/UAQ-20(V)](http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/real-time-computing/6/125)

- seymour cray designed first NTDS computer in 1957
- Lincoln Labs' study of SAGE's impact caused Navy to develop NTDS

## [NTDS Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Tactical_Data_System)

### General

- computerized information processing system
- developed by US Navy 1950s
- used in combat ships
    - took reports from multiple sensors on different ships and collated it to
        produce a single unifed map of the battlespace
    - info relayed back to ships and weapons operators


### Prior Attempts

- "blips" on radar screens
    - same screen shared across ship
    - later shared across ships
- downfalls:
    - reliability of analog circuits to run system
- why personal computers were better than analog circuits?
    - removal of moving parts
    - data could simply be sent from one to another digitally
        - digital data was just sent and then read by another computer
        - replaced need to code/decode analog signals representing plots

### System Implementation

- NTDS is navy version of air force's SAGE
- development, starting in 1956, was possible because of
    - mid 1950's development of computers, specifically
        - navy's interest in code breaking computers
        - new, bettee transistors
        - core memory
- NTDS used transistorized digital computer and __wireless data links__
    - ships could share info gathered by sensors on other ships in task force
- NTDS was inspiration for Aegis system
    - Aegis now used on Navy ships

- most NTDS computers water-cooled, some later were air-cooled
- ASW Ships Command & Control System (antisubmarine warfare) was NTDS system

### NTDS

- automate collection of data into overall tactical picture
- used many identical computers together, real time, advanced I/O system
- ships were connected via radio links
- several computers on the same ship were able to talk directly which was a
    first
- the computers also could communicate with other equipment like displays and
    communications gear
- 1960-1962:
    - after computers were designed w new transistors they were 2x as fast and
        more reliable
    - two destroyers & aircraft carrier passed service test making CP-642

- until NTDS collection and display of info related to position of nearby
    aircraft, ships, and submarines was done manually
- NTDS automated this information flow reducing chance of error
- also shared information among ships in task force

### Historical Background

- NTDS was developed due to research from many projects, but three in particular
    - Project Cornfield
        - U of Illinois, Control Systems Laboratory
        - used digital computers for logical solution to threat evaluation and
            weapons assignment problems and the rapid correlation and
            dissemination of information derived from a network of search radars
        - only had vacuum tubes at time so huge machines, used one master
            computer on master ship to control sensors
        - regected because it was a central control design and couldn't be
            any single ship
    - Project Cosmos
        - Bell Laboratories
        - comprehensive study covering communications and data processing
        - helped describe what navy had to fix in the communications aspects for
            data handling systems
    - Project Lamplight
        - MIT's Lincoln Labs
        - SAGE was around already
        - study around how a SAGElike system could be applied seaward, because
            they knew fundamentally an air system would be flawed at sea
        - one LAMPLIGHT report recoomended the development of a Fleet Data
            System, specifically digital oriented. thus NTDS

- Commander McNally and Commander Svendsen took project LAMPLIGHT to more
    concrete design
- envisioned building equipment as "building blocks" so both large and small
    ships use the same equipment, but bigger ships will be more powerful
    because they'll have more of these modules
- adding more equipment ship would be easy, just adding another module, not
    redesigning ships entire system
- radar displays would be standard and serve all specialists using radar
- no single failure point on ship, so at least two critical items ex. computers
- Bureau of SHips as lead developing agency
    - McNally as project cordinator and Svendsen as assistant
