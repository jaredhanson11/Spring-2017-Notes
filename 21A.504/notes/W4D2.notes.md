Paper due in two weeks.

## The Turing Test

- __Alan Turing__
    - 1937 he published paper, 'Uncomputable Numbers'
        - question
            - if I have logical statement, is there way to prove if this
                statement is correct or incorrect
        - theory of Turing Machine came from paper, to solve question
            - not actual machine, but the theoretical idea of machine
            - machine was made later by enthusiasts
- __Turing Machine__
    - it was theoretical, not actually made by Allen
        - used to prove a point
    - supposed to be pretty simple
    - in principle this could answer a solution to any logical statement
    - infinite tape with different symbols/instructions
- when war breaks out in Europe, enlists for military research
    - research mainly around code breaking
- after war ends, starts research around machines that can model human logic
- 1952, starts taking female hormones instead of jail for punishment for being gay
- 1954, commits suicide by apple with cyanide
- __The Imitation Game__
    - man vs. women
        - interrogator tries to guess who's man/woman
        - man tries to deceive
        - woman tries to show she's a woman
    - gender is a performance
        - unlike sex, gender is a series of attitude style, etc, that we learn from
            living in a certain culture
    - man vs. computer
        - same concept as before, just no woman, now machine
    - computer becomes metaphor
        - intelligence is disembodied
- major philosophical critiques against AI
    - script based programming, can't be real because programs don't have
        intentions
    - lead to Chinese room test
- __Chinese Room Test__
    - trapped in room
    - tries to translate chinese with a frew queues
    - gives him hints allowing him to answer question
    - claim
        - this person answered question in Chinese because instructions
        - does it mean he knows Chinese?
            - argument that being able to answer doesn't mean intelligence

## Early AI Research

- birth of AI
    - conference at Dartmouth
        - intended to bring 10 researchers for 6 weeks and from that perspective,
            conference was a failure
            - no one stayed for 6 weeks
            - no one was really interested in listening to each other
        - after this conference though, AI was really born
        - conference also gave rise to dominant approach to AI know as either
            - __Symbolic AI__, or
            - __information processing research__
        - many of the biggest researchers in AI were there
- John McCarthy
    - first use of term artificial intelligence
    - __Automata Theory__ was the name before artificial intelligence
- Herbert Simon & Allen Newell made machine that proved some theorems
    - research gave rise to new metaphor/model, in 1956
        - computer != brain anymore in sense its not about hardware and wiring
        - now comptuer == thinking, software , and instructions, and how to think/logic
- in 1950's and 1960's the military supported all research
- AI was all about figuring out how humans think
    - if you could figure out how humans make decisions, you can program that
        into computers
    - specifically how a man thoght
        - how gender operates was inscribed in early AI
        - because men were all the ones doing research
        - kept this idea that men were intelligent

## Chess Playing and the Receding Horizon

- why is chess so much of the forefront for artificial intelligence
    - of everything in the world to define intelligence, why is chess the one thing that
        is labeled as intelligence
    - chess was pinnacle of intelligence
    - turing makes theoretical program to play chess
        - never implemented
        - not enough computing power
- two approaches from chess playing
    - brute force approach
        - black box, not like human thinking, just giving desired behavior
    - human heuristic approach
        - model how humans actually think and cues from being humans
    - debate now do intelligent machines need to think like humans, or just
        give behavior like humans and get that behavior in any way?
- 1997 Deep Blue beats the best chess player in the world
    - celebrated, but what came from the victory?
        - many people concluded brute force really wasn't intelligence
        - you bypass the thinking/intelligence around chess with brute force
- __Receding Horizon__
    - we might have to redefine the idea of intelligence as we build new machines
- Alpha Go
    - doesn't model human intelligence anymore
    - but instead gives you access to big data processing that brains can't do
- AI is unique because it forces us to think about the essential characteristics that make us humans
- AI is the ultimate reflection of humans and human identity and human thought
