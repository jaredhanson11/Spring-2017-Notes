# Lecture ?: Virtual Reality

## Intro

- Zuckerberg visions that the new world will be completely intertwined with
    the real world
- VR is a "looking glass into the mathematical wonderland" - quoted from 1965
- either Zuckerberg or the 1960's both vision preach full emersion

## Early Computer Graphics

- computer screens are metaphors as windows into another world
- Ivan Sutherland
    - head mounted display
        - initially it was for military helicopter operators with infrared for
            landing at night, started idea of new world using technology enhancing
        - was also proven when people wore glasses with video of ball coming at
            their head, and they all ducked
        - went to U of Utah for computer graphics
        - started private company for simulators for military. like tank and
            plane simulators
        - __new idea, computers now are window into another reality__
- University of Utah was huge huge player in the computer graphics world
- problems in early graphics
    - making round and smooth objects smooth, not pixelated
    - making things appear in the back and the front in graphics
- __military industrial and entertainment complex__
    - Atari: huge player in the computer graphics space
    - Pixar: was all about rendering software, renderman, which allows u to specify
        light sorce, camera angle etc
        - this same program that was used to create Toy Story, was applied to the
            medical and scientific fields

## Simulation and WAR

- write Alma about medical and architectural applications or VR
- architects don't learn 3D modeling anymore, they use softwares for modeling
- virtual reality and simulation is used in surgerical room for training

Virtual reality in the military:

- SIMNET: simulated network
    - train soldiers for large scale attacks in time of peacetime
    - more concentrated around teaching teamwork as a group not just teaching how
        to fly a plane or something individual specific/ equipment specific
    - group of simulators and windows to give soldiers limited information
    - they took real places and modeled them in the simulators
- most remarkable, baffling, irconic uses of virtual reality int alma's mind is
    the use VR for treating PTSD, specifically for soldiers in battle
    - soldiers with PTSD lots of time surpress their emotions
    - VR is able to bring up these emotions in people again helping them deal w it
