### by Lorraine Datson
p.182-202

- Festival of Reason
    - Nov 10, 1793
    - marching through streets
        - 'To Philosophy'
- French commisioned monument
    - instructions to leave `"nothing to desire with respect to exactitude, but
        [also to be] the most vast and imposing monument to calcualtion ever
        executed or even conceived"`
    - never completed, but calculations were crazy for the monumemt
- French finally put into law the metric system
- history of calculation in Elnightenment is a chapter in culterual history of
    intelligence
    - not mechanical yet, purely mental
- calculation started as mental processes that weren't integlligent
- calculation was still activity of scientist or mathematician, not average joe
- By turn of 19th century, calculation was shifting from savatns and philoosophes
and now arthimatic was everywhere
- calculation shifted to lowest of mental processes
- women were delegated all of table making and calculation for satatistical
    projects until end of WWII
- Prony's project in 1791
    - calculate 10,000 sine values to 25 decimal places
    - calculate 200,000 logs to 14 decimal places
    - manufactured the tables
        - pyramid structure
            - designer of answer(handful of brilliant people)
            - getting of numbers for answer(7-8people)
            - computers of numbers(70-8)
    - finished in 1801
    - project didn't really get used to the fullest extent
        - most tables only went 8 decimal places max
    - project was more symbolism and putting excitement around a great
        mathematical feat
    - huge because it __pushed calculation away from intelligence and more
        towards work__
- Prony was a huge player in division of labor for math
- Prony's machine was more the design of how to divide labor
    - more precise, elegante, less manufacturish
    - french
- Babbage's machine was legions of artisans doing calculations
    - Prony then tried to switch to machines replacing calculator labor
    - more brute, get an answer, factory type work
    - british

- Prony and Babbage both accepted computers
- associated with astronomers and mathematicians

> The prototypical French large manufacture turned out small quantities of
> finely crafted work, grand objects intended to reflect and magnify the grandeur
> of their purchasers. This was exactly the sort of object Prony and the
> Revolutionary regime had envisioned the cadastral tables to be.


*Sang* thought you could never trust machines for calculations, because of
mechanical mistakes
