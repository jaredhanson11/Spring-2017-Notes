## Learning Objectives
- primary objectives
    - evaluate/critique computer sytems
    - apply technical knowledge in designing system components
        - how common design patterns, like __modularity__ and __abstraction__, limit complexity
        - how OS's use __virtualization__ and __abstraction__ for modularity
        - how internet is designed to scale
        - how realiable systems are built on unreliable networks
        - common pitfalls in security of computer systems


## Course structure

### Lectures
- twice a week
    - MW 2-3pm, 26-100
- designed to teach students the technical details necessary to design their
    own systems

### Recitations
- twice a week
- practice sytem analysis and oral communication
- every recitation revolves around a paper in systems

### Writing Tutorials
- every friday
- learn to use writing to develop and deepen technical understanding
- give specific instruction of writing and presenting 6.033 assignments

## Grading
__35%: Technical Material__  
- 30% for Quizzes (two @ 15% each)
- 5% for Hands-ons

__40%: Communication + System design and analysis__  
- 10% for DP preliminary report + DP presentation
- 20% for DP report
- 2% for the DP peer review
- 8% for critiques (2 @ 4% each)

__25%: Participation__  
- 20% for recitation participation
- 5% for communication participation

__Late Policy__
- S3 for all late assignments or missed quizes
    - except design-project material
        - late policy for those is on each assignment

__Unless otherwise noted, assignments are due at 5:00 pm on assigned due dates__
- note, hands-on assingments are due at 11:59 pm

## Grade Components

### Technical Material

- __Quizzes__
    - two quizes
        - each cover half of term
        - final is just second quiz (non-cumulative)
    - test whether students ahve mastered technical material
- __Hands-On__
    - usually every week
    - usually require Athena machine
    - reiforce some abstract concepts from lectures

### Communication and System Design Analysis

__Design Project__
- allow students to design their own system
- teams of 3
- __deliverables__:
    - preliminary report
        - graded by recitation instructor and writing instructor, grading rubrick
            - letter grade
        - makes sure design in on right track
        - incorporate feedback into presentaion/report
    - oral presentation
        - graded by recitation instructor
            - graded on check, check+, check-
                - examples: (preliminary report + oral presentation) = overall grade for both
                    - `B + check = B`
                    - `B + check+ = A`
                    - `B + check- = C`
        - should reflect preliminary feedback
        - informs final report
        - presentation focuses on changes since preliminary report, rather
            than recapping entire system
    - extended final report
        - graded by recitation instructor
            - letter grade
    - peer review
        - graded by TA and writing instructor
            - letter grade

__System Critiques__
- two system critiques assigned
- graded by TA's and writing instructor
    - letter grade
- expectations detailed in tutorials
- as writing improves during semester, critques should too


### Participation

__Recitation Participation__
- criteria
    - pay attention to instructor
    - participate in pair/group-work
    - volunteer to ask instructor
    - respond to other student's comments with opionions of your own
    - do reading, turn in pre-reading questions
- grade in two parts
    - grade based on that half of semester
    - first half of semester
    - second half of semester
- two preliminary grades
    - designed to let you know where you stand
    - 1/4 way in semester
    - 3/4 way in semester

__Communication Participation__
over a third of the grade comes from written assignments, take it seriously

### Collaboration
- no collaboration on hands-on assignments or quizzes
- allowed on all assignments
    - acknowledge contributions of ideas by others
        - classmates
        - papers
        - etc
