## Pre-Recitation

### Reading: Section 4.4

Questions to think of while reading:
- What is the benefit of a recursive query?
- What are the benefits of DNS's hierarchical design?
- Are there any drawbacks to DNS's design?

#### 4.4 Case Study: DNS
- Good example of successful implementation of naming scheme
- DNS designed for computer, but is general-purpose name management and name
    resolution sysstem
    - hierarchically distributes management of names among different naming
        authorities
    - hierarchically distributes the job of resolving names to different naming
        servers
- allows rapid responses to requests and provides extreme scalability
- additionally is really resilient to many server and network failures

- __DNS__:
    - associates *domain name* with *internet address*
    - __internet address__:
        - machine-oriented binary identi ers for network attachment points
    - __domain names__:
        - user-friendly character-string names
        - hierarchically structured
        - __domain__: it is simply a set of one or more names that have the
            same hierarchical ancestor
            - can be single attachment point or hierarchical region
        - components seperated by dots
        - least significant component to most significant
        - relative and absolute path names allowed
            - relative path distinguished by trailing dot
                - trailing dot rarely there, DNS_RESOLVE instead applies
                    simple form of multiple lookup

    - typical DNS implementations
        - use text editor, or db manager to manage table of bindings
        - tables loaded onto DNS servers
            - this makes is such that DNS changes aren't immendiate, but can
                take hours to propogate through internet

- What is the purpose of DNS?
- How does it work?
- Why was it designed to work that way?
