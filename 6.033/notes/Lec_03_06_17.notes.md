# Lecture 8: Intro to Networking
## What is a Network
Tasks that networks need to accomplish

- __naming and adressing__: assigning unique names (or __addresses:__ names imbued
with location information) to nodes
- __routing:__ each node learns a min-cost route to every other reachable node
    - __packets:__ `| _ _ header _ _ | _ _ data _ _ |`
        - packet header contains
            - source: who sent it
            - destination: where its going
        - sometimes switches can get more packets than can process
            - store these packets in a queue
            - switches queue's can be full
            - when they become full, packets are dropped
- __transport:__ sharing the network efficiently and fairly, dealing with
    reliablity and differing application needs, etc.
    - this always gives our packets a chance, but still never guranteed that
        the packets will get through
