# Recitation 12: Data Center TCP (DCTCP)

## Pre-Rcitation
Skip section 3.3 about estimate of K
Skim section 4
Pay attention to figure 15 and 19.

What is the goal of DCTCP?

- use less buffer space on the nodes
- low latency to handle short flows, high burst tolerance, high utilization for
    long flows
- uses commomodity switches


How does DCTCP differ from TCP?

- uses ECN in the network
- multibit feeback on congestion in the network resulfs from a single bit
    stream of ECN marks
- requires only 30 exra lines than TCP, and setting the single parameter on the
    switches

Why does DCTCP differ from TCP?

- machine's forground tasks get bogged down with usage from the background TCP task
- it doesn't allow a large queue sizes to add up

## In-Class

- Queries
- short ocntrol
- file transfers

- DCTCP is a lot like MapReduce in the way in runs its tasks in parallel
- its all about small buffers
- DCTCP is for smaller queries that are needed in extremely fast time
    - using parallelization like in mapreduce it splits the processing and
        forces the workers to complete in a certain time or that info isn't
        added into the result
