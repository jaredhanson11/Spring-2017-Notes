- Bounded buffers
- concurrency
- locks

*today's goal:* implement __bounded buffers__ so programs can communicate

## Bounded buffers
__bounded buffer:__ buffer that store (up to) N messages  
__bounded buffer API:__
```
 send(m)
 m <- receive()
```

Bounded buffer biggest source of complexity/bugs:  
__concurrency__

### Key Questions for bounded buffers
- When is it okay to write?
- When is it okay to read?
- Where to write and read?

#### Ex. Bounded buffer
```
N = 5
in = <int:messages written>
out = <int:messages read>
buffer = [ n length long ]
```

- When okay to write?
    - `if in - out < N`
- When okay to read?
    - `in > out`
- Where okay to read/write?
    - `out % N = index to write`
    - `in % N = index to read`

## Locks
__locks:__ allow only one CPU to be inside a piece of code at a time  
__lock API:__
```
  acquire(1)
  release(1)
```
