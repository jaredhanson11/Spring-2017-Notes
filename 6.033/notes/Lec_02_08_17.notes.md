    - midterm and final
    - final is just like second midterm

## Computer Systems Overview
__What is a system?__  
a set of interconnected components that has an expected behavior observed at the interface with its environment

__What makes building systems difficult?__
- complexity
    - examples based on length of codebase
        - Linux Kernel: ~10mil
        - Large Handron Collider: ~50mil
        - Facebook frontend only: ~62mil
    - why complexity limits what we can build
        - too expensive
        - too hard to maintain
        - easily breakable
    - things that can occur in complex systems
        - __emergent properties__
        - __incommensurate scaling__
            - what happens when things get very big?
        - __propagation of effects__
            - ex: call forwarding, I have forwarding to Spencer, he has forwarding to me,
                infinite loop

__What do we want from our computer systems?__
- simplicity
- scalability
- reliable
- performance
- security

Tradeoffs depending on the system you are designing.

__How do we mitigate complexity?__  
with design priniciples, *modularity* and *abstraction*

- __Modularity__
    - Layers
        - examples:
            - don't need to use terminal to use computer bc GUI is layered on top
        - benefits:
            - allows you to leverage complex layers without needing to know how
                it was built/build it
- __Hierarchy__
    - examples:
        - 6.033: teacher, ta, la, students
        - mit: president, teachers, students
    - benefits:
        - allows for bigger growth

__How do we enforce modularity?__
- client/server model
    - RPCs: Remote Procedure Call
        - send requests, receive responses
        - benefits:
            - seperation of concerns
        - downside:
            - procedure calls can get lost in internet
                - explanation: if you never got response for a post request, say buying a
                    car, then resend that post request, you will rebuy the car
                - fix: send uid with post request to buy car, check that
                    uid if new post request is sent (request sent because
                    server response lost in internet)
                    - solves problem, but creates state on server, so what if
                        the server crashes
