# Lecture ?: File-Sharing

P2P Networks, CDNs and more

Client server model:

- Server holds file that clients are requesting
- When files exist only on one server the files are not accessible if that
    server holding the single copy fails.
- To minimize load on a single server, buy more servers to hold the data and then
send requests to those different servers.
    - this network is not scalable though because money is limited resource

## P2P: Peer to Peer File Sharing

- puts clients to work by making them servers for files that they have already
    downloaded
- this assumes that everyone in the network who downloads a file allows their
    computer to serve that file to others

### BitTorrent

__problem:__ how do you incentives peers in a P2P network to upload

- blocks, 16 KB's, unit of exchange in bit torrent
- request blocks from your neighbor nodes
