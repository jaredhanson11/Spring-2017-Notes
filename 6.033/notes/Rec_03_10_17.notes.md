# Tutorial: Intro to DP

## System Critque Issues and Suggestions
- intros should describe the sytem by identifying and defining moudules, then
    stating their interactions
    - naming is not enought to identify/describe
    - describing processes is not sufficient to define the system and its
        components
- a background section is not necessary -- don't do it
    - just give enough info to motivate the
        new system and its primary design goals
- link design choices to the stated or implied goals they support (or don't
    support)
- assess whether the system is designed to meet specified goals and whether it
    meets those goals in practice

__System critique, what is it?__

- Articulate what the system is
- what the features/design choices are in the system, and why were they
    added/what was the purpose
- analyze these decisions

## DP Preliminary Report Requiremnets
- Clearly lay out the prolem/challenges
- charaterize your system and how it soves the prolem
- state any assumptions
- address the use cases consided in design project

### Current Group Assessment
What don't you know?

- we don't know which failures we will/won't cover
- we don't know a title

What do you know?

- we know the design components we want cover
- we know how who is going to initially tackle each design component

How do you best articulate this?

## DP Key Goals
- What terms and ideas should you design?
    - data driven
    - selectively using camera feeds
    - and feedback
- main metrics to track
    - bus on time
    - number of people on bus
- failure recovery
    - make clear that we value letting a route go to shit over messing up
        another route to try and fix the route from going to shit
