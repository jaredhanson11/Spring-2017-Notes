# Lecture 6: Kernels and VM's
## Kernels
Can we rely on the kernel to work properly?  
No. Over 20,000 bugs reported since 2002.

Linux Kernel
- virtually no modularity within Kernel itself
- pretty much just one big C program
- *monolithic kernel*  

__Monolithic kernels:__ no enforced modularity within the kernel itself  
__microkernels:__ enforce modularity by putting subsystems in user programs  
- benefits
    - if one type of kernel crashes, entire machine doesn't crash too
- why not microkernels?
    1. communication costs
        - much more costly to communicate between modules than simple procedure call
    2. crashes are still bad
        - maybe less bad, but still bad nonetheless
            - what if filesystem kernel crashes, even if computer doesn't crash
                you can't use computer like usual so whats the benefit of
                keeping computer running anyway
    3. dependencies
        - sharing caches differently
        - creates added complexity
    4. re-designing takes effort
        - designing kernel takes lots of time
    5. can make iterations difficult
- not saying these downsides make microkernels not more practical than
    monolithic, simply these are why Linux kernel is not microkernels

### How do we deal with bugs in the linux kernel without redesigning Linux from scratch?
- one kernel crash shouldn't bring down the house
- virtualization good
    - virtual machines!
- abstraction not so good
    - don't want to have to update kernels to use them
    - want compatability

## Virtual Machines
For purposes of lecture, virtual machines are going to be running in parallel
as opposed to having a host operation system or a master OS  

- problem:
    - if gues OSes run in kernel mode, we haven't solved or origin program,
    - if they run in user mode, they can't execute privileged instructions

- solution:
    - VMM(virtual machine monitor) runs in kernel-mode on hardware
        - virtualizes hardware for all the guest OSes
    - guest OSes run in user-mode

### VMM (virtual machine monitor)
__VMM's job__  
1. Deal with privelactiveSection eged instructions
2. allocate resources
3. dispatch events

- Guest OS is always in user mode
    - tries to execute privileged instructions
        - throws exception
    - VMM will __trap__ and __emulate__ instructions
        - can't try to trap/emulate every instruction or it will be much too
            slow

VMM's goal: virtualize hardware  
- Guest OS sits on top of virtual hardware
- VMM manages virtual hardware to physical hardware
- basically just adds another page table

Guest OS:  
- tries to load ptr (page table rank??) 
    - throws exeception
- VMM takes exception
    - three page tables (old way)
        1. guest virtual -> guest physical __guest os page table__
        2. guest physical -> host physical __vmm page table__
        3. guest virtual -> host physical __host page table__
    - new way
        1. VMM tranlates from guest virtual to host physical itself

1. Paravirtualizatioin
    - Modify guest OSes a little bit to allow for use
    - easy to change linux kernel, hard to change windows OS kernel
    - bad
2. binary translation
    - initially did this
    - ??
3. hardware support
    - modern VMM's take this approach
    - arguably the best of the three
    - in addition to user and kernel modes, add "VMM mode"
        - allows guest mode to execute like in kernel modes sometimes??
    - why in hardware and not just in software
        - hardware is fast, software is very slow
        - added to hardware once VM's became a lot more popular
            - probably unneccesary to add into hardware until it became so popular
