# 6.033: Tutorial 1
02/10/17

## Introductions
- How do you introduce yourself to someone?
    - Generally we just know how to do it

### Genre as social action
A __genre__ fulfills a *purpose* for an *audience* in a recurring situation (a *context*)

#### Examples of genres

| Oral | Written |
| ---- | ------- |
| Toast | Grant proposal |
| Lecture | Reccomendation Letter |
| Eulogy | Concert review |
| Closing argument | Lab report |

### Expertise and shared knowledge shape genres
__Expert knowledge__ : about your audience, context and commone reason patterns

### Design principles
Complexity <--> Abstraction

simplicity, scalability, reliability, performance, security


## Exercise: What how and why
- Therac:
    - what:
        - __medical linear accelerators (linacs)__
        - more, still valid, whats:
            - tumors
            - tissue
            - electrons
            - high energy beams
            - etc., etc.
    - how:
        - explaining the affects and use cases of linacs
        - more specific:
            - accelerate electrons
            - create high energy beams
            - treated with accelerated
    - why:
        - miminal impact on the surrounding healthy tissue
        - to reach deeper tissue
    - underlying assumptions:
        - tumors are bad
        - we want to get rid of them
- DNS:
    - what
        - Computer systems
            - construction, configuration, operations
    - how
        - using names
            - without needing to know details of how subsystem refers to its
                components
        - using subsystems
        - modularity, abstraction
    - why
        - to achieve modularity
            - essential to use subsystem without knowing how it works
    - underlying assumptions
        - modularity is good
        - names
- MapReduce
    - what
        - MapReduce
            - Programming model
        - real world tasks, shown in this paper
    - how
        - specify map function
            - genereate set of intermediate key/value pars
        - specify reduce function
            - merges all intermediate values
    - why
        - processing and generating large data sets
        - many real world tasks are expressible in this model

## Summary
- Friday tutorial addresses the design project and critiques
- purpose in 6.033 is to make *implicit* expert knwoledge, into *explicit*
    knowledge for you

## Deadlines
