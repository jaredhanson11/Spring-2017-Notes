# Recitation: RON
## Pre-Recitation
What is the goal of RON?

- RONs quickly detect and recover from failure, disconnection, or interference
- Goals:
    1. failure detection/recovery in less than 20 seconds
    2. allow for tighter integration of routing and path selection
    3. expressive policy routing



How was it designed to meet this goal?

1. RON permits groups of nodes to monitor and communicate about the various
    Internet paths connecting the nodes RON nodes will exchange information
    about the complication among each other and determine whether to reroute the
    packet by way of other RON nodes.
2. RON allows separate applications to classify failures differently, by
   allowing them to place more or less importance on metrics like throughput,
   latency, etc.
3. RONs usually run on powerful machines, so it makes is well suited to
   provide fine graded policy routing


Why do we need RON? (Or why do the authors believe that we need RON?)

1. Existing BGP-4 protocol takes a long time to converge to a new valide route
   after a link failure
   - it can't detect problems like packet floods or persistent congestion
2. This makes RON much more of a unviversal solution across all applications,
   because different applications have different requirments. For example, TCP
   might classify a system failure from over 30% packet loss, while UDP would
   do so for over 10% loss, because the protocols have separate requirements.
3. BGP-4 is incapable of expressing fine grained plicies aimed at users/hosts
    - impossible to announce a BGP route only to particular users

## Recitation

- Often blurr the lines between networking and operating systems
- Operating Systems papers are likely to be really technical/equationy/etc

### Overlay Networks
- a network running on top of another network
- allows for added functionality
    - not in lower layers because not everyone uses them
    - or because they use them all differently

### RON
__Resilient Overlay Network:__ routes around failures on a network faster than
that network can itself

- __active measurement:__ injecting traffic in network to do measurements
    - advantage: allows you to double check failures to validate them
    - disadvantage: puts added load on network
- __passive measurement:__ just observing the real traffic to do measurements
    - advantage: no added load on network, not adding anything
    - disadvantage: can't tell if failures are true or just an anomoly

- first choice is always to just use the internet
- if that fails then it will use the RON network
- each RON node keeps a table of the measurement of cost to each other RON node
    in its RON network
- if a failure happens, then send RON packet to one other RON node who will
    figure out how to send it to the destination node
