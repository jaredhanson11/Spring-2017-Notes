# Lecture: Routing

__goal of routing protocol:__ allow each switch te know, for every node `dst`
in the network a route to `dst`

__goal of routing protocol:__ build a routing table at each switch, such that
`routing_table[dst]` contains a minimum-cost route to `dst`

## Distributed Routing

1. Nodes learn about their neighbors via `HELLO` protocol
    - `HELLO` protocol is when two nodes basically just say `HELLO` to each
        other extremely frequently
        - this protocol helps us discover network failures if someone stops
            saying hello
2. Nodes learn about other reachable nodes via advertisements
3. Nodes determine minimum-cost routes (of the routes they know about)

- __convergence time:__ time to make all switches consistent
- __overhead:__ overhead of keeping advertisements on machines

### Link State Routing

- Advertisements: list of X's neighbor and link costs to those neighbors
    - Often times just use djikstra's on known graph of networks to find
        shortest path
    - Received by all nodes
        - Flooding: propogates advertisment to all machines on network
            - I tell my neighbors, my neighbors tell their neighbors etc
            - any protocol using floading is very likely not to be able to scale
- Nodes can infer topology
- handling failures is easy

- overhead of advertisements: high
    - can't store graph of network all on one router
- convergence time: low

### Distance Vector

- Advertisements: list of all nodes and X's current cost to them
    - Received only by X's neighbors
- Nodes can't infer topology
- handling failures is trickier

- overhead of advertisements: low
- convergence time: high

## Routing Problem

__Problem:__ neither distance-vector nor link-state routing will scale to the
size of the internet

### Scalable Routing

1. __path-vector routing:__ advertisements include paths
    - to better detect routing loops
    - overhead is worse than distance-vector, but much better than link-state
2. __hierarchy of routing:__ route between ASes, and within an AS
    - __AS:__ autonomous systems
    - ASess use link-state routing to set up networks
    - across ASes use __BGP__
3. __topological addressing:__ assign addresses in contiguous blocks to make
   advertisements smaller
   - BGP routes to machines, not to ASes though, because it handles individual
       machines better, and not just ASes systems
       - ASes will be up pretty much all the time, so doesn't make sense to see
           that the entire AS is up and running

## ASes

Autonomous System

__Problem:__ ASes also need a means to implement policy

- ASes are often times competitors
    - Comcast & Verizon
    - MIT
- They will only send packets if they are going to make money, leads to
- __Selectively Advertising:__
    - As an AS I will only advertise the routes that will make me money
        - This means ASes will know all the nodes in its network, but will only
            advertise to other ASes when its beneficial to them

    - __Problem:__ how to determine what routes ASes will advertise?
    - __Solutions:__
        - __customer/provider ('transit'):__ customer pays provider for transit
            - comcast wants to be as connected as possible or no one will pay them
        - __peers:__ peers allow ('free') mutual access to each other's customers
            - as long as amount of traffic in each direction is roughly equal
            - often times isn't the case is because it rarely saves you money
- Export Policies
    - __customer/provider:__ provider tells everyone about themselves, their
        customers, and tell their customers about everyone
    - __peers:__ peers tell each other about their customers
