## Collaborative Writing

How to deal with a team member who is not contributing?  
- Start off with the other teammates bringing up the issue to the non
    contributing member.
- Setting goals as a team, and making sure to track progress towards these
    goals.

## Parallel Writing
How will your team make decisions about the desing of your project, particuarly
related to disagreements?  

Before talking about how to make decisions as a team, it is important to
distiguish these decisions into categories, as all design choices aren't equal.
I think that all big decisions, that have an huge impact on the entire team and
project as a whole, should be unanimous decisions. Decisions that maybe aren't
as major, and only affect a small portion of our project/grade.
