# Tutorial 2: Reasoning Framework for System Design
## Last time
Why rhetorical approach?

- identify common genre components
- make implicit knowledge, explicit knowledge

### Excersise: What's the best tv show?
- What does best even mean?

## What-how-why offers a resonsing framework
Helps us:

- organize our understanding of systems
- report on/explain systems in recitiation

### What
- __Facts__: need to agree on the facts before you can even have an arugment
    - who
    - what
    - when
    - where
    - how much
    - examples:
        - `I shot the sheriff`
- __Definition__
    - what kind of thing
    - how should we use this thing
    - examples:
        - As a reaction to this complexity, we designed `a new abstraction`

### How
- __causation__
    - how did it happen
    - why did it happen
    - what other affects
    - examples:
        - we designed a new abstraction that `allows us to express`
        - Our abstraction `is inspired by`
        - `in order to combine` the derived data properly

### Why
- __value__
    - how much does it matter
    - how good/bad is it
    - why do we care
    - examples:
- __action/policy__
    - what should we do
    - how to proceed
    - examples:

### Stasis theory: Fact vs Definition
__closed stasis:__ everyone accepts and agrees on the facts  
__open statis:__ is when people don't agree on the same stuff  

*facts denoted by italics*  
__definitions denoted by bold__  

Fact-fact:
- *I shot the sheriff,* but *I did not shoot the deputy.*

Fact-definition:
- *I shot the sheriff,* but __I swear it was self defense.__
