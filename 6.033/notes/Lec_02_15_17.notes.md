- Operating systems
- Virtual memory
- OS abstractions

__Memory == RAM__

On quiz:
- Virtual address to physical address

## Operating systems
__OS: enforces modularity on a single machine via *virtualization* and *abstraction*__

keys of OS's?
- __multiplexing__
    - multiple programs running at once
- __isolation__
    - one program doesn't affect another
- __cooperation__
- __portability__
    - write program per OS, not per machine
- __performance__

OS needs to:
- manage memory(RAM)
    - programs shouldn't be able to refer and corrupt each others memory
    - virtual memory
- communicate
- share a CPU

OS does all this via:
- __virtualization__

## Virtualization
__virtualization__: technique used by OS's to enforce modularity on a single machine

Problem:
- Memory(RAM) stores data, instructions, etc.
- programs need the data, instructions, etc.
    - programs designed so that they have access to all memory
- if two programs try to access same memory, concurrency bugs can appear

Virtualization:
- __virtual addresses__
    - CPU gets virtual addresses instead of physical addresses
        - give CPU chunk of memory, but using virtual addresses
    - __MMU__ transfers from physical address to virtual

### MMU(memory management unit)
_MMU_: lookup table to translate virtual to physical

#### How to store the MMU
__naive way__:
- one virtual address per physical address
- problem:
    - table is way to big, can't even store it in virtual

##### Page tables
solves analogy: finding word in textbook
- find me 1200204th word
- find me the second work ond the 134 page (page table)

Page Table Entry
    - 32 bits:
        - 20 bits physical page number
        - 12 bits additional info
            - last bit: is page present
            - second to last bit: read/write bit
                - program allowed to writ
            - third to last bit: supervisor bit
                - allows kernel mode????
Problem
- still too much memory for table

Solution
- Page the page table

__Many pages approach__:
- page the page table
- doesn't have to preload all the pages???

### Kernel
__kernel__: manages *page faults* and other *interrupts*
- go to kernel mode,
