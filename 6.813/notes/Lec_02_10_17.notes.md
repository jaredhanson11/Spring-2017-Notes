## Learning apporaches

- Stata Trash Cans
    - Old version
        - Using pictures/labels to associate with trash in hand
            - negative: if your trash doesn't match any picture, often you throw it
                all in the trash out of uncertainty
        - Using consistent color queues of trash can labels
        - Imitate, learning by watching, watch the people in front of you
            - Phones and laptops are much more personal, so not a lot of learning by watching
                - Youtube allows for a lot more learning by watching of computers
    - New version
        - Use different style of trash slots this time
            - Recycling has bottle/paper looking slot
                - allows you to asscociate throwing away paper/bottles with recycling
            - Trash has smallest square opening
                - maybe to discourage you from throwing away
        - Entire trash cans are color coded now, not just labels
        - Single, big icons on front
        - Short, one liner descriptions on label
        - Different ordering
            - Maybe to retrain user to so they see other options before
                defaulting to just throwing away

## Interaction styles

        - Physical ations or labeled button presses
        - Rapid, incremental, or labeled button presses
    - Google street view examples of DM (direct manipulation):
        - click and drag on the map (physical actions)
        - arrow keys (labeled button presses)
