Tester 1:

- the names of the exercises were confused
- wasn't sure if she got the answer right yet or not
- she figured out that it was revealing background after 2 answers
- liked the revealing of the picture
- she liked the sound affects of a wrong answer
- knew to ask for help after we asked her to look, but didn't really realize
  that button was there at first
- the hints didn't help her
- delay before showing the pop up after finishing
- clicking next excersise, after finishing game, but don't know what the next
  excersise is
- don't tell them the idea behind the cards, and just try to have them find the
  cards themselves (about our shitty demo lol)
- didn't think images motivated her, but maybe for young kids it would?
